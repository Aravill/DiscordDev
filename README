### DiscordDev ###
This project consists of a simple nodejs bot that will in time have functions
to play music or pull information form game statistic sites and a css discord
theme. Both parts of this project are meant to help me learn more about discord
and it's api.
To make the custom discord theme work, you'll need a 3rd party css injector for
discord like BetterDiscord or (preffered by me) BeautifulDiscord.
For security reasons, the discord bot files are missing the "auth.json" because
it has the bot security token. If you wish to make the bot work, you'll need to
register a discord application through the www.discordapp.com website and get
your own token
